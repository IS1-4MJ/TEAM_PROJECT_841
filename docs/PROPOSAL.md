What AI system are you interested in investigating further and why?

    Our AI system is a simple handwriter. Our AI system writes the digits 0-9 
    in a handwritten way. We are interested in a handwriter AI system to help 
    us fill in simple numeric blanks in a handwritten format as a nicety for 
    form use and to make form use easier. If we have sufficient time, we will 
    expand this project to cover a-z 0-9 as well.

What content knowledge (theories and concepts) does the AI system use?

    editor     : Vestine
    The content knowledge the AI system uses is a DCGAN and physics of drawing. 
    The project will feature a custom symbolic AI that draws slightly amiss 
    characters using acceleration, velocity, and position alongside a variable
    real-time continuous pen-width float. An ideal number will be used, and the
    pen will drift towards the ideal with a random perturbance to add realism. 
    The theory at play here is that such parts suffice to generate realistic 
    looking numbers, if a little common. 
    The project will also feature a standard DCGAN AI trained on the MNIST 
    dataset to generate DCGAN images into a pipeline that feeds such images 
    into a writing queue to be written into a png file which can be copied and 
    pasted into a desired medium.


What tools, platforms, and APIs are needed to develop the AI system?

    lead author: Joseph Islam
    editor     : Vestine
    The project will use basic built in tools to represent the symbolic AI,
    while the project will use python, keras, pandas, and numpy for the DCGAN 
    in play here. The symbolic AI’s tools are needed to write the AI from 
    scratch. The DCGAN’s tools are needed to take advantage of Google’s already 
    existing neural network progress by using the keras package.

What example illustrates the basic "ingredients" of the AI system?

    lead author: Vestine 
    editor     : Joseph Islam
    Using the GitHub repository, GitBash and PyCharm to get our project repository.
    Using feature branches to make any changes to the file as corborators and 
    push the origin. 
    Write codes from scratch, Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
    (DCGAN) and physical drawing pencil.
    Our AI system is going to use numbers from 0 to 9. The prediction is to 
    have those numbers in handwritten instead of regular numbers in our computers.
    Numeric prediction is to write any number between 0 to 9 on a computer and
    get its handwritten number.  
    Classification is going to use deep learning which is going to operate on
    data or codes to a text handwritten to an image  like a handwritten number.
    Workflow and rules will be there to show the way writing any number between
    0 to 9 displays the handwritten of that number

What are the considerations for developing a safe and trustworthy AI system?

    lead author:Vestine 
    editor     : Joseph
    Explainability : Understand our AI system which is handwriter, how it works
    and the purpose of building that. Being able to explain to the audience
    how it works and how to build it if it is necessary.
    Integrity: Us as developers will consider the output of our AI system and 
    the purpose of that AI system. The results need to match with our predefined plan.
    Conscious development: Handwriter AI system will be beneficial with humans.
    They will be familiar with numbers from 0-9 in handwritten using their 
    computers. That system will be fun for all ages. Comp841 classmates and 
    Professor will work to improve our AI system by asking some questions 
    or giving us some comments.
    Reproducibility: using generating reproducible outcomes which will bring 
    clear results. The codes, the algorithm and artifacts will be clear and 
    understandable by developers and Humans. 
    Regulations: 
    Handwriter AI system will be controlled by us team (Vestine & Joseph), 
    it is not going to violate any user privacy, 
    it is going to be built in transparency, 
    it is not going to use any bias which will help any humans to use it,
    It is safe for environment and living being
    Its design will have some mechanism of responsibility and accountability  


What are the ethical considerations in determining the legitimate use of the AI system?

    lead author: Vestine & Joseph
    editor     : Joseph & Vestine
    Our AI system should respect the law which means that it is going to respect human dignity, freedoms and rights. 
    With integrity: its output should match with 
    Shift from general to specific
    Consider moratoriums carefully
	
    We use the categorical imperative by Immaneul Kant to determine the ethical
    nature of the project. In particular, imagine a world in which everyone were 
    to use our tool in its fullest to fill out forms. Whenever someone would sign a 
    form, the tool would be used. This would result in anyone signing a form having
    identical handwriting, nullifying the uniqueness of the signature. However,
    today, digital signatures are commonplace and signature uniques is not an 
    ethical concern. Hence, the legitimate use of the system as intended is not 
    ethically unsound.

	The misuse potential perspective would yield little due to the highly limited
    scope of the tool’s effect.
