    Introduction
        What AI system are you interested in investigating further?
            We are interested in comparing symbolic and deep learning approaches
            to a snake game AI as our project. The Snake in the snake game
            is on a board, which is the environment, turns left, right, up, or down
            as its actions, acts with full autonomy post release, which is 
            some degree of autonomy, and attempts to grow as much as possible,
            which represents a goal, so the snake game AI is complicit with the 
            European commission 2021 definition of an AI.
        Why is it of interest to you?
            The Snake game AI is of interest to us because the Snake game AI
            is a simple example of a path finding AI. A path finding AI is an
            AI which finds a path from the AI agent's current position to a target
            position. Such a path could be found simply using the A* algorithm,
            as presented, but such a path could also be found using a deep
            neural network. We explore the differences between these two
            approaches in this project.
        What specifically you'll focus on? WHat's the overall guiding question
            your study will pursue?
            Our study will particularly focus on what the key performance
            differences between the A* algorithm and the deep learning algorithm
            are. Similarly, we will investigate the similarities.
            

  Theoretical Background

    - What areas or fields of AI provide the theoretical framework of the AI system?
        Symbolic Ai's search subfield provides the theoretical framework of 
        the AI system via the A* Algorithm. Symbolic AI is AI that reduces the 
        search space of a options set. CSPs, The A* Algorithm is a search 
        algorithm designed to solve the graph traversal's shortest path problem.
        A* works by doing x, y, and z, and pilots the snake head towards food
        in this pygame implementation of Snake.
        
        Similarly, this project makes use of a connectivistic Deep Neural 
        network to train a snake to find food in a similarly open map. A deep 
        neural network is a kind neural network, which is a kind of of Directed 
        Acyclic Graph (DAG). Such a graph, as a neural network, has weights as edges, an input array,
        and an output activation function. Connecting many neural networks 
        together into one big neural network makes a deep neural network, at a
        high level; More technically, A deep neural network is a neural network
        with 2 or more layers.

    - What are the key concepts and techniques that the AI system is based on?
        The key concepts and techniques that the AI system is based on are
        the deep neural network and the A* search algorithm.
