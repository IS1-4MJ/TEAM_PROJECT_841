    Introduction
        What AI system are you interested in investigating further?
            We are interested the AlphaZero-boosted AI System from cgreer's 
            github repository. This system consists of an implementation of the 
            AlphaZero algorithm with Gradient Boosted Decision Trees instead of
            A deep neural network for a -value and a policy- function.
            Whatever the symbolic part of AlphaZero is the symbolic part of 
            the system. Whatever the neural part of Alphazero is the 
            neural part. The game plays connect four, which is a two player
            game in which both players add player tiles to a grid to connect -  
            to put in alignment - 4 tiles in a row, either diagonally, 
            vertically, or horizontally.
        Why is it of interest to you?
            AlphaZero is of interest to us because 
        What specifically you'll focus on? WHat's the overall guiding question
            your study will pursue?
