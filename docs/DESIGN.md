    Introduction
        What AI system are you interested in investigating further?
            We are interested the AlphaZero-boosted AI System from cgreer's 
            github repository. This system consists of an implementation of the 
            AlphaZero algorithm with Gradient Boosted Decision Trees instead of
            A deep neural network for a -value and a policy- function.
            Whatever the symbolic part of AlphaZero is the symbolic part of 
            the system. Whatever the neural part of Alphazero is the 
            neural part. The game plays connect four, which is a two player
            game in which both players add player tiles to a grid to connect -  
            to put in alignment - 4 tiles in a row, either diagonally, 
            vertically, or horizontally.
        Why is it of interest to you?
            AlphaZero is of interest to us because 
        What specifically you'll focus on? WHat's the overall guiding question
            your study will pursue?
            

  Theoretical Background

    - What areas or fields of AI provide the theoretical framework of the AI system?
        Symbolic Ai's search subfield provides the theoretical framework of 
        the AI system via the A* Algorithm. Symbolic AI is AI that reduces the 
        search space of a options set. CSPs, The A* Algorithm is a search 
        algorithm designed to solve the graph traversal's shortest path problem.
        A* works by doing x, y, and z, and pilots the snake head towards food
        in this pygame implementation of Snake.
        
        Similarly, this project makes use of a connectivistic Deep Neural 
        network to train a snake to find food in a similarly open map. A deep 
        neural network is a kind neural network, which is a kind of of Directed 
        Acyclic Graph (DAG). Such a graph, as a neural network, has weights as edges, an input array,
        and an output activation function. Connecting many neural networks 
        together into one big neural network makes a deep neural network, at a
        high level; More technically, A deep neural network is a neural network
        with 2 or more layers.

    - What are the key concepts and techniques that the AI system is based on?
        The key concepts and techniques that the AI system is based on are
        the deep neural network and the A* search algorithm.
