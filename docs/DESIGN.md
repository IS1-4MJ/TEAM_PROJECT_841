    Introduction
        What AI system are you interested in investigating further?
            We are interested the AlphaZero-boosted AI System from cgreer's 
            github repository. This system consists of an implementation of the 
            AlphaZero algorithm with Gradient Boosted Decision Trees instead of
            A deep neural network for a -value and a policy- function.
            Whatever the symbolic part of AlphaZero is the symbolic part of 
            the system. Whatever the neural part of Alphazero is the 
            neural part. The game plays connect four, which is a two player
            game in which both players add player tiles to a grid to connect -  
            to put in alignment - 4 tiles in a row, either diagonally, 
            vertically, or horizontally.
        Why is it of interest to you?
            AlphaZero is of interest to us because 
        What specifically you'll focus on? WHat's the overall guiding question
            your study will pursue?
            

  Theoretical Background
  

Working Example
Deep Reinforcement learning for Snake Game in interaction of two components:
* environment (the game its self): Snake game is an AI system uses adaptive path finding a star algorithm to efficiently 
  play the snack game.This game uses two dimensions array of zeros, ones and negative ones.
  Zeros are open space, ones are either the snake's tail or the objects and negative ones are the snack food.
* agent (snake)
